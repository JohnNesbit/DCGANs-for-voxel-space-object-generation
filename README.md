# Installation
if you want to run this script yourself then download the ZIP file and then install
needed libraries.
After this replace the paths at the top to thier respecive paths in your system
after that run train.py !

# note
I previously had this library using .binvox file formats because of
how easy they were to integrate however, I have switched to .off files because of more
widespread support therefore, one of the data libraries, chairs should be deleted as it is non-essential.
